## Challenges to overcome with this project

- Using Clerk for auth, left users outside of my own DB, so I had to implement backend code to add in the user data when fetching posts.
- This was my first fullstack project using T3 stack on my own, with not much guidance outside of a similar tutorial project I did called [chirp clone](https://github.com/jadenenz/chirp-clone).
- This was also one of my first typescript projects so I had to work my way through quite a few typescript gotcha's and type safety errors.
